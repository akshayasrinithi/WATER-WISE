# Water-Wise

## Overview

**Water-Wise** is an innovative project designed to harness and save condensed water generated by air conditioning units. This initiative addresses the growing concern of water wastage and aims to provide a sustainable solution for water conservation. Utilizing cutting-edge technology, Water-Wise collects condensed water, monitors its usage, and visualizes data using Wokwi, ThingSpeak, and Unity.

## Features

- **Water Collection**: Efficiently collects condensed water from air conditioning units.
- **Data Monitoring**: Tracks the amount of water collected and stored.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Uses ThingSpeak to display water collection data.
- **Interactive Representation**: Visualizes the project in a 3D environment using Unity.
- **Repurposing Options**: Provides practical applications for the collected water.

## Repurposing Ideas

1. **Watering Home Plants**: Use the collected condensed water to nourish indoor and outdoor plants, providing them with a sustainable water source.
  
2. **Purifying for Stray Animals**: Implement a filtration system to purify the condensed water, making it safe for stray animals to drink.
  
3. **Irrigation for Gardens**: Utilize the water for garden irrigation, reducing dependency on municipal water sources.
  
4. **Cleaning Purposes**: Repurpose the condensed water for cleaning windows or outdoor furniture, offering an eco-friendly alternative to tap water.
  
5. **Cooling Systems**: Use the collected water in evaporative cooling systems for outdoor spaces, reducing temperature and enhancing comfort.

## Technologies Used

- **Wokwi**: For simulating and prototyping electronic circuits.
- **ThingSpeak**: To collect, store, and visualize data online.
- **Unity**: For creating an interactive 3D representation of the water collection process.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-wise.git
   cd water-wise
   ```

2. **Set up Wokwi**:
   - Visit [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) and create your circuit using the provided components.
   - Import the Wokwi project files from the repository.

3. **ThingSpeak Configuration**:
   - Sign up for a ThingSpeak account at [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/).
   - Create a new channel to store your water collection data.
   - Update the API keys in your project code.

4. **Unity Setup**:
   - Download and install Unity Hub.
   - Create a new 3D project and import the assets from the repository.
   - Set up the scene to represent the water collection process.

## Usage

1. **Run the Wokwi Simulation**: Start the simulation to see how the water collection system operates.
2. **Monitor Water Collection**: Check the ThingSpeak channel for real-time data on the amount of condensed water collected.
3. **Explore the Unity Visualization**: Launch the Unity project to interact with the 3D representation of your water-saving system.
